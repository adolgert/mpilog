This is a demonstration of using the Python mpi4py. The batch file
is specific to the Texas Advanced Computing Center's Lonestar machine.

The actual mpi4py sample does very little and is taken from the
mpi4py documentation. More interesting is the logging.

Logging from many worker tasks usually opens a separate file for each
task. This batch job starts a logging service on the head node before
starting worker tasks. The logging service listens over UDP for 
the worker tasks to send messages. When the job is finished, the
batch script kills the logging service.
